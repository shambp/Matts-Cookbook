## Instructions

### DOUGH

1. **Prepare the tangzhong:**  
   Whisk **180 ml whole milk** and **31 g all-purpose flour** in a medium saucepan until smooth. Place saucepan over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until thickened and whisk lines are visible on the bottom of the pan (about 2 minutes). Scrape tangzhong into the bowl of a stand mixer and let cool.  

2. **Combine ingredients:**  
   Add **1 large egg**, **7 g instant yeast**, **67 g granulated sugar**, **17 g Diamond Crystal or 9 g Morton kosher salt**, and remaining **375 ml whole milk** to tangzhong and whisk to combine. Add remaining **688 g all-purpose flour**. Attach the dough hook to the stand mixer and mix on low speed until combined (about 1 minute). Increase speed to medium-low and mix until dough is smooth and elastic, 18–24 minutes. Stretch a small piece of dough between your fingers; it’s ready if you can see light through it without breaking.  

3. **Incorporate butter:**  
   Add **113 g unsalted butter**, one piece at a time, and mix on medium speed until incorporated (about 2 minutes). Continue mixing until dough pulls away cleanly from the bowl and is no longer tacky (5–7 minutes). Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let the dough rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, 60–90 minutes.

### FILLING

4. **Prepare the filling:**  
   Cook **113 g unsalted butter** in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it foams and milk solids turn dark amber (about 4 minutes). Transfer to a heatproof bowl and let cool slightly. Add **200 g dark brown sugar**, **16 g ground cinnamon**, **30 ml heavy cream**, and **3 g Diamond Crystal or 1.5 g Morton kosher salt**. Mix until smooth.

### FROSTING AND ASSEMBLY

5. **Prepare the pans:**  
   Grease two **23 cm** cake pans with butter. Punch down the risen dough and transfer it to a lightly floured surface. Stretch the dough into a rectangle. Let it rest for 5–10 minutes if it feels stiff. Roll into a rectangle approximately **60 cm x 30 cm**. Spread the filling evenly across the dough.  

6. **Shape the rolls:**  
   Tightly roll the dough into a log, seam side down. Trim the ends and cut the log in half. Continue halving each piece until you have **12 rounds**. Place **6 rounds** into each prepared pan. Cover with damp towels and let rise until doubled in size, about 30–50 minutes. Preheat oven to **180°C fan-forced** (200°C conventional).  

7. **Bake:**  
   Bake rolls for **25–30 minutes**, until golden and puffed.  

8. **Make the frosting:**  
   Beat **57 g unsalted butter** and **226 g cream cheese** in a large bowl until smooth. Add **138 g powdered sugar**, **15 ml heavy cream**, **1 tsp lemon zest** (optional), and a pinch of salt. Mix until smooth and creamy.  

9. **Finish and serve:**  
   Let the rolls cool slightly, remove from the pans, frost generously, and enjoy!
