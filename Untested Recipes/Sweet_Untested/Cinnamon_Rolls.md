## DOUGH

### Step 1  
Whisk **¾ cup whole milk** and **¼ cup (31 g) all-purpose flour** in a medium saucepan until smooth. Place saucepan over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is thickened and whisk lines are visible on bottom of pan, about 2 minutes. Scrape tangzhong into the bowl of a stand mixer and let cool.

### Step 2  
Add **1 large egg**, **one ¼-oz. envelope instant yeast (about 2¼ tsp.)**, **⅓ cup (67 g) granulated sugar**, **1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt**, and remaining **1½ cups whole milk** to tangzhong and whisk to combine. Add remaining **5½ cups (688 g) all-purpose flour**. Fit bowl onto stand mixer; fit mixer with dough hook attachment. Mix on low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-low and mix, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally, until dough is smooth and elastic, 18–24 minutes. Pinch off a golf-ball-size piece of dough and stretch between your fingers as thin as possible without breaking. If you can see light through the dough, it’s ready. If not, continue mixing a few more minutes, then try again.

### Step 3  
Add **½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature, cut into pieces**, to dough and mix on medium speed until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Continue mixing until dough pulls away cleanly from sides of bowl and is no longer tacky to the touch, 5–7 minutes longer. Remove bowl from mixer and cover with a damp kitchen towel. Let sit in a warm spot until doubled in volume, 60–90 minutes.

### Step 4  
While the dough is rising, cook **½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter** in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until butter foams and milk solids turn dark amber, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and let cool slightly. Add **1 cup (packed; 200 g) dark brown sugar**, **2 Tbsp. ground cinnamon**, **2 Tbsp. heavy cream**, and **½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt** to butter and mix to combine.
