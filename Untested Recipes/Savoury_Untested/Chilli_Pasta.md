## Ingredients

- 2 big chicken breasts
- 225g pasta (go with your gut man)
- 1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes
- 2 shallots (Can substitute for a mild onion)
- 1 orange
- crushed Calabrian chili paste or another mild chili paste/oil
- a few garlic cloves
- a few sprigs of parsley
- butter (can skip this ngl)

## Method

- Get a pot of water boiling
- Butterfly Chicken Breast
    - Season with salt and pepper before cooking
    - Put a film of Oil into the pan and start browning chicken
        - Use less if you are using a non-stick pan
    - Keep cooking until it is just done on the inside
        - A good indicator is juice starting to come out of the chicken btw
- While the chicken is cooking:
    - Peel and chop garlic (minced) and shallots (quarter moons, half then half then slice)
        - Reserve a third of this garlic
    - Cut tomatoes in half (I like using cherry tomatoes)
    - Zest an orange
        - Combine this zest with a third of your garlic
        - Chope up fine and add fresh parsley (add dried parsley after chopping this up if you prefer)
- Once the chicken is finished
    - Remove chicken from pan, add shallots and tomatoes and use the water that comes out to deglaze your pan (ignore the deglazing step if you are on non stick)
    - Water should be boiling, place pasta in water
- Once the tomatoes begint to fall apart
    - Stir garlic and cook for a minute
    - Juice orange and cook until sauce is thick
    - Kill the heat and stir in butter once sauce calms down
    - Add some pepper
    - Slice the chicken breast and throw back into the pan
    - Stir in chili paste
    - Taste for seasoning
- Eat!
