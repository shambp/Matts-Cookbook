# Pesto Pasta

> my recipe, probably a million other people that have come up with this genius idea before tho, recipe feeds about 2 people, adjust accordingly

## Ingredients

- Choose a Meat
  - Smoked Salmon is fire
  - Chorizo is fire
  - Chicken is fire
    - Chorizo and chicken together is really nice if you need to feed more than like 2 people and want some variety
- Small bag of spinach
- Tomato/basil pesto
    - If you are doing Salmon, I would strongly suggest tomato pesto, chorizo and chicken is chefs choice
- Small bottle of thickened cream
- Pasta
  - I think shorter pasta is best here
    - Fusilli
    - Mafalda Corte (my fav)
- Chilli Flakes (optional)

## Method

- Get a pot filled with water and start getting it boiled
- If you are doing Chorizo, chuck these in a pan and get some colour on them
    - only a tiny bit of oil is required, these will render a tonne of flat
- If you are doing chicken or smoked salmon, simply shred it into bite sized pieces
- Start of by cracking out a measuring cup and putting in:
  - Your jar of pesto
  - like half of your cream, honestly up to you
  - Season the sauce
  - chuck in chilli flakes and other herbs/spices
    - this is a freestyle segment, put whatever you think looks nice in
- Cook ur pasta when water is boiling
- Once pasta is cooked, drain **most** of the water, leaving a small amount behind, return the pasta back to the pot
- Throw in your sauce, Chorizo (with the fat)/chicken/smoked salmon and mix to combine
- eat
