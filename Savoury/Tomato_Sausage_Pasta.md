# Tomato Sausage Pasta

` Photo goes here `

> another one of those recipes that everyone and their mum has, this is my not a riff riff on the topic

## Ingredients

- 500gish pack of sausages
    - Pork and beef is my fav
    - Mince is also an amazing choice.
- 1 onion
- Pasta of your choosing
- Jar of red sauce
- Spinach


## Method

- Start of by getting a pot of water on the boil
- Dice your onion
- Slice your casings down the centre and squeeze out the meat from your sausages
    - It is a good idea to throw them in a bowl ready for the next step
    - Season with salt, pepper, paprika, italian herbs, chilli flakes or whatever else you think sounds nice
- Get your pan hot and put in a small amount of oil
    - Sausages will render a tonne of fat
- Throw in your onions for a few minutes and let them sweat
- After they turn slightly transluscent, throw in your sausages and get them going
    - Sausage meat is a bit hard to break up, you are going to need to be consistent with chopping it up in the pan and mixing for longer than you would normally with mince
- Throw in the sauce when you are terrified the fond is going to burn in the pan
    - Let it reduce for a sec and put it to the side
- You pasta should be boiling at this point
    - Throw it in and cook it, drain it (put a bit of the water in your sauce first), turn your pan back on and toss the pasta in. Letting them get to know eachother.
