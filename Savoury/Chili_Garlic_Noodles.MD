# Chili Garlic Noodles

> Credit to Ian Fujimoto

for 2ish meals

## Ingredients

- 2 cloves garlic
- half a knob of ginger
  - I am going to be so real, I just buy the cold pressed stuff and put in a shitload, tastes just as good
- 1 bunch spring onions
- chilli flakes
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp black vinegar
- 1 tbsp sugar
- sesame seeds (just a good amount is fine)
- 500g Ground Pork
- 2 portions of a thinner noodle
  - Also super nice as a rice dish, is definitely my preference since I can make rice pudding after with the leftovers :)

## Method
- Get yourself prepped
  - Get your rice going, or get a pot of water on the stove to start boiling
  - Slice up your spring onions and throw them in a bowl with your minced garlic and grated ginger
  - In another bowl throw in
    - 2 tbsp soy sauce
    - 1 tbsp black vinegar
      - you CAN use white vinegar if you have to, is nowhere near as good though
    - pinch of sugar
    - however many sesame seeds you like
      - sesame oil is a good substitute in a pinch
    - bunch of chilli flakes
      - also super nice if you add in some of the cold pressed chilli as well
- Cooking phase
- Get a pan ripping hot
  - Chuck in garlic, ginger and spring onions
  - Once fragrant, add pork and season
  - At about this stage you want to throw your noodles in, 
I like to take my time browning the pork so by the time the pork is ready the noddles are too.
  - Throw in sauce and simmer until desired consistency
- Once noodles are cooked
  - throw in noodles with a little bit of water.
- enjoy
