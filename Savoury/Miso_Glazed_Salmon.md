## Ingredients

- 500ish grams of Salmon
- 1/4 cup miso paste
    - white and red are super nice, but I prefer red :)
- 2 tbsp Soy Sauce
    - I like to use Tamari
- 1 tbsp Brown Sugar
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- Some veggies of your choice
    - huge fan of brocoli and carrot in this
        - We will be using some of the marinade to glaze these veggies

## Method
- De-skin (if needed) Salmon and season
- Grab a small bowel and add in your
    - 1/4 cup miso
    - 2 tbsp soy sauce
    - 1 tbsp brown sugar
    - 1 tbsp rice vinegar
    - 1 tsp sesame oil
- Whisk to combine and throw your salmon in
    - let it sit for about 3 hours
- After this waiting period preheat your oven to 180c fan forced and get your side dishes ready
    - Great time to get some rice going
    - get your veggies sorted
    - also would be yum for some miso soup on the side if that is your thing
- After preheating
    - Bake your salmon for 15ish minutes or until your fish is done to your preferred donesness
        - Optionally, you can stop a few minutes before its done, crank the grill and brush it with some of the leftover marinade
- Plate and eat!
