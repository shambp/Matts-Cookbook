## Ingredients

- 500ish grams of Salmon
- 2tbsp cup miso paste
    - white and red are super nice
        - white will be a bit milder
        - red is my personal preference.
- 1 tbsp Soy Sauce
    - I like to use Tamari
- 1/2 tbsp Brown Sugar
- 1/2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1/2 tsp sesame oil
- Side dishes of your choice
    - I love roasted veggies with this
    - If ur a huge miso fan some miso soup on the side definitely wouldn't hurt
    - Rice is obviously also a banger for this to give the dish some more substance
    - etc

> Halve the marinade amounts if you aren't going to use it with your veggies

## Method
- De-skin (if needed) Salmon and season
    - Also a good idea to get them in 4 nice, even fillets
- Grab a small bowl and add in your
    - 1/4 cup miso
    - 2 tbsp soy sauce
    - 1 tbsp brown sugar
    - 1 tbsp rice vinegar
    - 1 tsp sesame oil
- Whisk to combine and throw your salmon in
    - let it sit for about 3 hours
        - Letting it sit for a bit longer is fine, you dont have to be perfect
- After this waiting period preheat your oven to 180c fan forced and get your side dishes ready
    - Great time to get some rice going
    - get your veggies sorted
    - aGet your Miso soup 
    - etc
- After preheating
    - If you are using roasted veggies like carrots or broccolini, throw them in 15 minutes before you intend to add the salmon
    - Bake your salmon for 15ish minutes or until your fish is done to your preferred donesness
        - Optionally, you can stop a few minutes before its done, crank the grill and brush it with some of the leftover marinade
        - Keep in mind you literally CANNOT overcook salmon like ever, if you are not confident it is fine to air on the side of overcooked
- Plate and eat!
